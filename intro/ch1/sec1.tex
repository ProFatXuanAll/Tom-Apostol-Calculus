\section{The Two Basic Concepts of Calculus}\label{sec:1.1.1}

\begin{note}
  Calculus enables us to define the concepts of area and tangent line, and to calculate the area of a given region or the steepness of a given tangent line.
  Integral calculus deals with the problem of area.
  Differential calculus deals with the problem of tangents.
\end{note}
